    <h1>🌸You are THE best Mother:🌸</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Throughout my entire life you have consistently been one of the kindest, funniest, silliest people
      I have ever encountered.
      You make me laugh every day and remind
      me not to take life too seriously. You have a light airy colorful spirit (aura),
      which I think if we could see would be a nice bright yellow color.
    You have encouraged me to talk to the trees, and to listen to the rain.
      You taught me to connect with nature, and to connect to animals. You are
      a beautiful person inside and out! 🌻💘
      You are not just a mother to me, Tasha and Jesse, but to Annika,
      Lissi, Gianni, Tally, Cosmo, and Felipe. You spread love and happiness
      to all of us. We love you so much!❤️
      </p>
